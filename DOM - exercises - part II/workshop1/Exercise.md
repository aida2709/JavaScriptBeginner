a) Retrieve the list (`ul`) and set its class to `list-group`.

b) Retrieve all list items (`li`) and set their class to `list-group-item`.

c) Ask the user to enter the index of the skill they know best. After that, find the corresponding list item (`li`) in the list and set its class to `active`.

d) Improve the previous case by doing the following if the user enters an invalid index:
- Create an `h3` element.
- Set its text to `The index you entered is not valid`.
- Add the class `text-danger` to it.
- Finally, append it to the body.

This task involves manipulating a list of items based on user input. The user selects a skill, and the code applies certain styles or shows an error message if the input is invalid.
