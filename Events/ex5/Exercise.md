Implement the following behavior:

- When the user types in the input with the id `tekst`, change the text color to red.
- When the user finishes typing (on focus out or blur), the text color should become yellow with a green background.
- If the word entered by the user is equal to `JavaScript`, display an alert with the message `Welcome to the JS course!`.
- If the text is selected, the background color should become blue.
