"Notice the div with the id `square` in the index.html.  
Create a mini game with the following features:
- The square should move (left, right, up, down) depending on which arrow key (left, right, up, down) is pressed on the keyboard, by 20px at a time.
- When the square is clicked, it changes color. With every click, the square should adopt a new randomly generated color."
