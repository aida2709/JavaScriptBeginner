Simulate the operation of a calculator.  
The user enters two numbers and an operator through a form.  
The result should be displayed and automatically calculated on every change in the input fields (firstNumber, secondNumber, operator).  
The DEL option should clear the contents of the input fields and the result.  
Note: Do not allow the user to enter more than one character in the operator field. Also, prevent the user from entering invalid characters in the operator field.
