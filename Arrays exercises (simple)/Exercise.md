Here is the translation of the tasks into English:

1. Given the array of numbers `let array = [45, 5, 7, 80, 10, 207, 113]`:
a) Print only those elements of the array that are two-digit numbers.
b) Count how many elements of the array are single-digit numbers.
c) Modify the existing array so that each number is multiplied by 2, resulting in the array `[90, 10, 14, 160, 20, 414, 226]`.
d) Sort the modified array in ascending order.
e) Then, sort it in descending order.
f) Calculate the average value of the array, and then remove all elements from the array whose value is greater than the average.

2. Given the array of students: `let students = ['Jasmyn Tamzen', 'Sam Farley', 'Di Melantha', 'Amias Alonzo', 'Archie Krystle', 'Tyla Rosanna', 'Mia Caris', 'Truman Kiaran']`:
a) Print all students whose name contains the letter `M` (either lowercase or uppercase).
b) Count how many students in total contain the letter `M` in their name.
c) Print all students whose first or last name starts with the letter `M`. Then, print how many such students there are.
d) Ask the user to enter the name and surname of the student they are searching for. Print the position of that student in the array.
e) Print all students sorted alphabetically.
f) Create a new array from the existing one, where the names and surnames of all students are separated by a hyphen instead of a space (e.g., instead of `Jasmyn Tamzen`, it should be `Jasmyn-Tamzen`).
