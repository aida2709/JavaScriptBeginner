The goal of this task is to convert human years into cat and dog years based on specific conversion rules. Here's how you can implement this functionality step by step:

1. Form Validation 
You need to validate the input form when the user submits their age. Before calculating the pet years, ensure that the form is valid:

The input should not be empty.

The input should be a number.

Check for validation when the user clicks the Calculate button.

If the input is invalid, show an error message in the humanYearsError div by removing the hide class.

If the input is valid, proceed with the calculation.

2. Calculate Cat and Dog Years 
Once the form is validated, calculate the cat and dog years based on the following rules:

Cat Years:
First year = 15 cat years.
Second year = 9 cat years.
Each additional year = 4 cat years.
Dog Years:
First year = 15 dog years.
Second year = 9 dog years.
Each additional year = 5 dog years.
3. Display Results (20 points)
Once the pet years are calculated, display them on the webpage:

Update the text inside the dogYears and catYears div elements with the calculated dog and cat years respectively.
4. Load Corresponding Images 
Load the appropriate images for the pet's age based on the calculated years:

For the Cat Image:
Baby cat (≤ 24 years) → Show a baby cat image.
Adult cat (24 < years ≤ 44) → Show an adult cat image.
Old cat (years > 44) → Show an old cat image.
For the Dog Image:
Baby dog (≤ 24 years) → Show a baby dog image.
Adult dog (24 < years ≤ 59) → Show an adult dog image.
Old dog (years > 59) → Show an old dog image.
You'll load the corresponding images from the images folder and set the src attribute of the catImg and dogImg elements based on the age range.
