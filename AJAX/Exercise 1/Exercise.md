## Cat Facts  
1. Create a button with the text `Get fact` (you can add it in `index.html`). The button should have the classes `btn btn-primary`.  
2. When this button is clicked, fetch data from the API endpoint `https://catfact.ninja/facts`.  
3. If the data is successfully retrieved from the API, create a list (`ul`) where each list item represents a fact fetched from the API. The `ul` should have the class `list-group`, and each list item should have the class `list-group-item`.  
4. If the API request fails, log an error message to the console.
