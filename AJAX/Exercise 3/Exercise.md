## Random Thing to Do  
1. Create a button with the text `Tell me what to do` (you can add it in `index.html`). The button should have the classes `btn btn-info`.  
2. When this button is clicked, fetch data from the API endpoint `https://www.boredapi.com/api/activity`.  
3. If the data is successfully retrieved from the API, create a table displaying the following information: `activity`, `participants`, `type`, and `price`. Each time the button is clicked, a new row with a new activity should be added to the table.  
4. If the API request fails, log an error message to the console.
