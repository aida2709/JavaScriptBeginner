```

a) Print all students who contain the letter `M` (either lowercase or uppercase) in their first name or last name.

c) Print all students whose first name or last name starts with the letter `M`. Then print how many such students there are in total.  
d) Ask the user to enter the full name of a student they are searching for. Print the position in the array where that student is located. If the student does not exist, display an appropriate message.  
e) Print all students sorted alphabetically by their last name.  
f) From the existing array, create a new array that contains all students with a hyphen between their first name and last name (e.g., instead of `Jasmyn Tamzen`, it should be `Jasmyn-Tamzen`). The resulting array should not have `firstName` and `lastName` attributes, but only `fullName`.  
g) Print the data of the student with the best average grade.  
h) Ask the user to enter a year (a number). From the existing array, create a new array that contains only students born in that year. If there are no such students, display an appropriate message.
