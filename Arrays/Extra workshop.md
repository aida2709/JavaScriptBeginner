1. Create an array of games, where each game has the following attributes:
   - Name
   - Company that made the game
   - Year of production
   - Rating
   a) Print all games sorted by year (from the oldest to the newest).
   b) Ask the user to input the name of the company they want to search for. Print all games where the company matches the input. If there are no such games, print an appropriate message.
   c) Ask the user to input a year of production. First, print all games that have a production year greater than or equal to the input, then print all games with a production year less than or equal to the input.
   d) Ask the user to input a rating and a production year. Print all games that have the same production year as the input and a rating greater than the input. If there are no such games, print an appropriate message.
   e) Ask the user to input the name, company, year of production, and rating. Create a new object from the input data and add it to the array. Then, print the array with all the games.
   f) Extend the solution from task e) so that you ask the user how many games they want to add, and create and add that many new objects to the array. Then, print the array with all the games.

2. Create an array of animals, where each animal has the following attributes:
   - Species
   - Name
   - Year of birth
   - Color
   a) Print all animals sorted by year of birth.
   b) Ask the user to input the color they want to search for, and print all animals whose color matches the input. If there are no results, print an appropriate message.
   c) Find and print the youngest animal. If there are multiple animals with the same year of birth, print them all.
   d) Ask the user how many animals they want to add. Then, ask for the species, name, year of birth, and color that many times. Add all these animal objects to the array. Then, print the array with all the animals.
